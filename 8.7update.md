# Aug. 7 update

## improvement

1. real PID control
2. add judge of op probe
3. add time monitor

## to do

1. test the improvement above with LH data
2. H coil preprogrammed wave
3. program two set of H bridge hardware (because sometimes IGBT broken)
4. add offset control between different mode
   - measure the offset of integrator and resistors and calculate the offset at idle time
   - measure TF offset using one channel and calculate the offset when discharge
   - set the coefficients at setup
5. the bug of line ending when TCP communication (maybe not necessary)
6. PF3 control test
7. H coil IGBT circuit



test LOW and HIGH
