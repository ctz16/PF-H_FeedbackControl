# 8.21 Update

## Summary

- update H preprogrammed wave, remain to be checked
- use average for offset to reduce noise
- add op limitation to stop feedback
- optimized PI parameters
  - increase I will increase oscillation, but will converge faster, increase P will make response faster, to find a balance may cost more time

## Task

- find out the TF signal coefficient due to resistors
- add communications to change all coefficients
- automate reading process
- find a method to tune the PI coefficient
